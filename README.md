- **[Unreal Audio Components (UE5 onwards)](https://github.com/NiallMoody/Audio-Programming-Resources/blob/fdb194a4f6d475214d9a12d6fab30694d1fe34ab/Unreal/exported/UE5%20Audio%20Schematic%20-%20New.pdf):** Diagram covering the primary audio components available in the Unreal engine (after the big UE5 audio updates; i.e. MetaSounds and Audio Modulation), and how they interact with each other (pdf)

**Note:** The PDFs include links to the appropriate Unreal documentation pages for each component, but github's pdf viewer doesn't support links. For that you will need to download the files.
